    <p>So today I just finished Clair Obscur, and overall I absolutely loved playing the game. 
        I really enjoyed the gameplay even though the parry mechanics were sometimes frame perfect timing,
        but I'm sure there will be an update at some point to adjust that. The story itself was absolutely beautiful
        with some parts moving me close to crying. The bosses also were some of my favorite. Of course I can't forget about
        the music of the game. The music was so good thats its hard to imagine that this was Lorien Toustard's first
        video game score. My favorite out of all them had to be "Une vie a t'aime" from the fight against Renoir.</p>

    <p>Ok it's been three days since I finished the game and I'm still playing Clair Obscur. Why?
        Because this optional boss fight is an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. While finishing up the rest of the endgame content,
        I ended up coming across a high level area in the ocean known as "Renoir's Drafts" which contained a lot of the final 
        enemies from the endgame. That however wasn't the issue, it is the boss that appears at the very end of it all, Simon.
        This boss is so ridiculously hard that I am still struggling three days late to actually finish it. Worse part
        is that just when I think i finally beat him and his 24 million health pool, a cutscene reveal he has a phase 2, which
        has triple the health, and his attack now have double the strikes I need to dodge and parry. If anyone has a suggestion,
        do let me know because the table below really shows how many times I've tried this the last 3 days.
